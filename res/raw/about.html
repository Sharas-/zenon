<h1>
    ZenOn will help you to <em>return to the present moment</em>
</h1>

<p>
    Start the app and you will get alerts at random times. When you get an alert, return from your thoughts into being
    here and now. Remain present as long as you can.
</p>

<p>
    Adjust your mindfulness level based on how easy it is to remain present for you. The lower the mindfulness level you
    set, the more frequently and periodically you will get an alert.
</p>

<p>
    There are five mindfulness levels:
<ul>
    <li>level 0 - {0}</li>
    <li>level 1 - {1}</li>
    <li>level 2 - {2}</li>
    <li>level 3 - {3}</li>
    <li>level 4 - {4}</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    Each level defines a time frame within which you will receive an alert.
    E.G. time frame (30min, 1.5h) means that you will get an alert somewhere between 30min and 1.5h
    With higher levels time frame increases along with randomness or unexpectedness of alerts.

    Happy zenning!
